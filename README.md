Ionic Photo Maps
=====================

This example app which I made to write this blogpost series:
http://codingsans.com/blog/ionic-2-app-with-native-plugin-integrations

## Install and run

You'll need the Ionic CLI with support for v2 apps:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

Then run:

```bash
$ ionic run android
```
or
```bash
$ ionic run ios
```
